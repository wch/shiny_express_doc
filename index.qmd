Shiny Express is a new way of writing Shiny apps that is intended to be easier to learn and quicker to write. We think that writing Shiny Express is comparable to Streamlit in terms of how easily you can create an app, but Shiny Express does not limit you the way that Streamlit does -- there is a much higher ceiling to what you can do with Shiny Express.

Shiny Express is still Shiny, just with a simpler syntax. It is currently available in the development version of Shiny on GitHub, but not on the released version on PyPI.

## Quickstart

The best way to introduce Shiny Express is by example. Here is a simple "Hello World" app:

```{shinylive-python}
#| standalone: true
#| components: [editor, viewer]
#| layout: vertical

from shiny import ui, render
from shiny.express import input

ui.input_slider("n", "N", min=1, max=50, value=30)

@render.text
def txt():
    return f"Hello! n*2 is {input.n() * 2}."
```

The slider input comes from `ui.input_slider()`, and the text output is a function that's decorated with `@render.text` and returns a string.

If you've seen traditional Shiny applications (which we'll now refer to as "Shiny Core" apps), you'll notice some important differences. Here's the same app written in Shiny Core form:

```{shinylive-python}
#| standalone: true
#| components: [editor, viewer]
#| layout: vertical
#| viewerHeight: 300
from shiny import App, ui, render

app_ui = ui.page_fillable(
    ui.input_slider("n", "N", min=1, max=50, value=30),
    ui.output_text_verbatim("txt"),
)

def server(input, output, session):
    @render.text
    def txt():
        return f"Hello! n*2 is {input.n() * 2}."

app = App(app_ui, server)
```

Not only is there significantly less code in the Express version, but there are fewer concepts to (mis)understand or be intimidated by.

Here's what's different in the Core app:

- The UI is created explicitly in a variable named `app_ui`, using nested calls to UI component functions.
- There is an explicitly defined server function. (This function is executed once for each browser session that connects to the app).
- The text output is created with `output_text_verbatim("txt")`. For Shiny Express mode, we didn't have to create that output -- it's created automatically when it sees the `@render.text`.
- There is an explicitly created object named `app`, which is a `shiny.App()` object.

Shiny Express apps do a these things implicitly, instead of requiring you to do them explicitly.

## Installation

As of this writing, Shiny Express has been merged to main but not published to PyPI. It can also be used on [shinylive.io](https://shinylive.io/py/examples/). (For embedding Shinylive applications in Quarto documents, it is technically possible, as this document shows, but it is a manual process as of this writing.)

To run these examples, you can use [shinylive.io](https://shinylive.io/py/examples/), or you can install shiny and htmltools from GitHub:

```default
pip install git+https://github.com/posit-dev/py-htmltools
pip install git+https://github.com/posit-dev/py-shiny
```


## Basic app with a plot

The example above shows a very bare-bones Shiny application. Here's one that's a little more sophisticated, with a layout component (a sidebar), and a plot.

```{shinylive-python}
#| standalone: true
#| components: [editor, viewer]
#| layout: vertical
#| viewerHeight: 300
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
from shiny import ui, render
from shiny.express import input, layout

np.random.seed(0)
data = np.random.randn(10000)

with layout.sidebar():
    ui.input_slider("num_bins", "Number of Bins", min=1, max=50, value=30)

@render.plot
def plot():
    plt.hist(data, bins=input.num_bins())
```

Contrast the Shiny Express code above with the Shiny Core equivalent below:

```{shinylive-python}
#| standalone: true
#| components: [editor, viewer]
#| layout: vertical
#| viewerHeight: 300
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
from shiny import App, ui, render

np.random.seed(0)
data = np.random.randn(10000)

app_ui = ui.page_sidebar(
    ui.sidebar(
        ui.input_slider("num_bins", "Number of Bins", min=1, max=50, value=30),
    ),
    ui.output_plot("plot"),
)

def server(input, output, session):
    @render.plot
    def plot():
        plt.hist(data, bins=input.num_bins())

app = App(app_ui, server)
```

Some things to notice:

- In the Core app, we first used the page-level component `ui.page_sidebar()`, and nested inside of that, a `ui.sidebar()`.
- In the Express app, we created a sidebar using `with layout.sidebar()`. (Under the hood, this component tells Shiny Express that the parent page component is `ui.page_sidebar()`).
- Notice that with the Express app used `express.layout.sidebar()`, while the Core app used `ui.sidebar()`. These are not quite the same thing -- the function in `express.layout` is actually a special wrapper for the function in `ui`, which can be used as a context manager.

## Motivation

With Shiny Express, our hope is to introduce a gentler simplicity/power tradeoff, that is nearly as easy as Streamlit but 1) not nearly as limited, and 2) leads you most of the way to Shiny Core.

## Caveats

While we believe that Shiny Express will turn out to be an effective tool for those new to Shiny, we also believe that it will not be appropriate for all use cases--hence our continuing belief in the Shiny Core model. A recurring theme you will find in the finer points below is that Shiny Express is easier to write but harder to manipulate and reason about, while Shiny Core demands more up-front learning and some small inconveniences in return for being easier to read and reason about as your apps get larger.

We also want to acknowledge the inherent risk of introducing a second (or depending on how you count, also a third and fourth!) way of writing Shiny apps. One risk is that Shiny Express will lead users into a learning cul-de-sac that is then harder to grow out of (and into Shiny Core) than if they had just learned Shiny in the first place--as we see Streamlit users cling to it long after they have left the domain where Streamlit works well. Another risk is that having two ways of doing things is just going to be confusing (see Panel, or on the mostly-positive side, Matplotlib).

## Differences between Express and Core

The main differences between Shiny Express and Core are the following:

- There is no separation between UI and server code. The UI and server code is mixed together.
- In Shiny Express, UI components can be nested by writing `with layout.xx()`, where `layout.xx()` is a component that can contain other UI elements.
- Shiny Express apps have `from shiny.express import ...`, `import shiny.express`, or `from shiny import express`. The presence of any of these statements tells Shiny that the app should be run in Express mode.


### No separation between UI and server code

In Core, UI and server logic are declared separately, with the UI containing `ui.output_xxx` objects to indicate _where_ each output goes and the server containing the logic indicating _what_ each output is.

```{shinylive-python}
#| standalone: true
#| components: [editor, viewer]
# Core
from shiny import ui, render, reactive, App
from datetime import datetime

app_ui = ui.page_fillable(
    ui.h1("Title"),
    ui.output_text_verbatim("greeting"),
)

def server(input, output, session):
    @reactive.Calc
    def time():
        reactive.invalidate_later(1)
        return datetime.now()

    @render.text
    def greeting():
        return f"Hello, world!\nIt's currently {time()}."

app = App(app_ui, server)
```

In Shiny Express, the top level of the Python file can contain both UI expressions and server declarations, in any order. By default, declaring a render function causes it to appear right in that spot.

```{shinylive-python}
#| standalone: true
#| components: [editor, viewer]
# Express
from shiny import ui, render, reactive, App
import shiny.express
from datetime import datetime

ui.h1("Title")

@reactive.Calc
def time():
    reactive.invalidate_later(1)
    return datetime.now()

@render.text
def greeting():
    return f"Hello, world!\nIt's currently {time()}."
```

Notice how `greeting` in this app does _not_ have a corresponding call to `output_text_verbatim("greeting")`. This is because in Shiny Express, the `render` functions automatically invoke that output function and add it to the page -- no need to do it manually.

#### Express advantages:

- It's nice for beginners not to have to learn about the difference between UI and server.
- Avoids having to write code in two different places for a single output, and having to make the IDs match up.
- No need to write nested function declarations (i.e. functions inside the server function), which can be surprising to Python programmers.

#### Core advantages:

- UI structure is clearer to read, reorder, and restructure. This advantage grows as app UIs grow larger.
- Explicit server function declaration gave us a natural place to put code that should only execute at startup (top level) versus for each session (server function body).

### Layout components using `with layout.xx()`

We'll use the term _layout components_ to refer to components that contain other components as children. For example, a sidebar is a layout component because it contains other components, whereas a `input_text()` is not a layout component because it has no children.

In Shiny Core, all components are available from the `ui` submodule, for example, `ui.sidebar()`, and `ui.input_text()`. You might create a simple app UI like this:

```{shinylive-python}
#| standalone: true
#| components: [editor, viewer]
#| layout: vertical
# Core
from shiny import ui, render, App

app_ui = ui.page_sidebar(
    ui.sidebar(
        ui.input_text("txt_in", "Type something here:"),
        fg="white",
        bg="black",
    ),
    ui.card(
        ui.output_text_verbatim("result"),
    )
)

def server(input, output, session):
    @render.text
    def result():
        return f"You entered '{input.txt_in()}'."

app = App(app_ui, server)
```


In Express apps, there are the following differences:

- There's no need to call `page_sidebar()` -- simply using `ui.sidebar()` tells Shiny to use `page_sidebar()`.
- Instead of `ui.sidebar()`, you use `with layout.sidebar()`. You still call `layout.sidebar()` with the named arguments, like `fg` and `bg`. The unnamed arguments will be used as children to the `sidebar`.
- You can even put the server code inside of the `with` statement.

```{shinylive-python}
#| standalone: true
#| components: [editor, viewer]
#| layout: vertical
# Express
from shiny import ui, render, App
from shiny.express import input, layout

with layout.sidebar(fg="white", bg="black"):
    ui.input_text("txt_in", "Type something here:")

with layout.card():
    @render.text
    def result():
        return f"You entered '{input.txt_in()}'."
```

Most of the layout component functions from `shiny.ui` have corresponding functions in `shiny.express.layout`. If you find that Express lacks a layout component that you need, please let us know.

Shiny Express layout functions can be nested, as in:

```{.python}
with layout.row():
    with layout.column(6):
        # Content here...
```

In an Express app, you can also still use Core layout components, like this:

```{.python}
ui.row(
    ui.column(
        ...,
        width=6
    )
)
```

This can be useful in some cases, like if you're writing a function that returns some UI.


### Page-level containers

In a Core app, the UI always has a top-level `page_` container, like `page_fluid()`, `page_fillable()`, or `page_sidebar()`.

In an Express app, there is also a top-level `page_` container, but the user does not need to call the function explicitly.

The default page container is `page_fillable()`. However, if you call `with layout.sidebar()`, then it will automatically set the page container to `page_sidebar()`.

You can set the page-level container explicitly by calling `layout.set_page()`. For example, suppose you want to use `page_fixed()` instead of `page_fillable()` (because you want flowing content with a constrained width). You would simply call this at the top of your app:

```{.python}
layout.set_page(layout.page_fixed())
```


### List of layout components

These are the components currently available in `express.layout`. Each of them has a counterpart in `ui`.

- `sidebar`
- `layout_column_wrap`
- `column`
- `row`
- `card`
- `accordion`
- `accordion_panel`
- `navset`
- `navset_card`
- `nav`
- `p`
- `div`
- `span`
- `pre`


## Deploying Shiny Express apps

To deploy Shiny Express apps on a Connect server or shinyapps.io, you will need to install a development version of the rsconnect-python package:

```default
pip install git+https://github.com/rstudio/rsconnect-python
```

You will also need to provide a `requirements.txt` file which tells the server to install htmltools and shiny from GitHub:

```default
# requirements.txt
htmltools@git+https://github.com/posit-dev/py-htmltools.git@main
shiny@git+https://github.com/posit-dev/py-shiny.git@main
```

Then deploy the app as usual. If you are in the directory containing the app, use the following command, replacing `<server name>` with the nickname for your server.

```default
rsconnect deploy shiny . -n <server name>
```
