This repository contains the source for a web site that explains how Shiny Express is different from Shiny Core. It was written and updated during the development of Shiny Express, but parts of it may be out of date.

The [official documentation](https://shiny.posit.co/py/docs/express-vs-core.html) is now a better resource for leraning about Shiny Express.
